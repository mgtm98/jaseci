# The Analysis Cache

The JIR module cache is the compiler's persistent analysis cache: every
module's cache file carries its **exported interface**, its **dependency
hashes**, and its **diagnostics**, and the compiler serves warm work from
those sections instead of recomputing it. This page records the design; the
[Phase 10 gate](compiler_architecture.md#the-jir-carries-semantics-decision-phase-10-gate)
in the architecture page records the decision this supersedes and the part
of it that still stands.

## What the gate got right, and what it missed

The Phase 10 gate rejected serializing *per-expression* semantics
(`Expr.type`, `callee_decl`), and that rejection stands: warm import-path
runs are already analysis-free, and a changed module must re-analyze
regardless of what any cache holds. But the gate was silent about two costs
it did not measure:

1. **The changed module's import closure.** Dependencies are ingested with
   the symtab-only schedule and demand inference walks into them, so every
   fresh `jac check` and every cold LSP start paid parse + symbol-table
   build + demand inference over the whole closure, every process.
2. **Diagnostics.** Nothing persisted them, so a warm no-edit `jac check`
   re-ran all eight analysis passes plus both boundary passes on every
   module, every process.

The analysis cache closes both gaps at the **interface** granularity: what a
module exports is small, stable, and exactly what importers consume.

## The three sections

All three live in the module's cache JIR
([`compiler/driver/jir.jac`](https://github.com/Jaseci-Labs/jaseci/blob/main/jac/jaclang/compiler/driver/jir.jac)),
written through the same atomic merge-write funnel as the bytecode sections,
and gated by the same `SEC_MODKEY`/`SEC_ENVKEY` freshness checks.

### `SEC_IFACE` -- the exported interface

The module's exported surface in the **stubcat-generalized encoding**
([`compiler/types/stubcat/`](https://github.com/Jaseci-Labs/jaseci/blob/main/jac/jaclang/compiler/types/stubcat/)):
typed symbols with evaluated types, signatures, overloads, archetype
layouts, enum members, plus the access, ownership, binding-kind, and native
capability facts that the cross-module checkers read. The payload is a
single-module stub catalog produced by `CatalogWriter` in *boundary* mode:
anything homed in another module is written as a stable **symbolic
cross-reference** (module path plus dotted symbol path), never as a pickled
object graph, so payloads stay small and identity survives round trips.

The payload is prefixed with its own sha256 -- the **interface hash**. The
hash names the encoding, so byte-identical surfaces hash identically and any
semantic change to the surface changes the hash. A compile that acted on an
*inferred* native placement verdict never persists an interface: only the
codegen flavor runs that verdict, and a module analyzed under it exports
native typing that analysis-only compiles (dependency ingestion, `jac
check`) never see, so a hash that depended on which flavor last persisted
the module would defeat the cutoff for every importer. Declared and pinned
placement is coerced at parse time in every flavor and is part of the
interface.

`compiler/types/stubcat/modiface.jac` holds the build/open entry points;
the typeshed stub catalog itself is the degenerate case of the same format
(whole-world boundary, no cross-references), which is why one codec serves
both.

### `SEC_DEPS` -- dependency hashes for early cutoff

One line per direct dependency: the dependency's resolved path and the
interface hash it had when this module compiled. Validating a module's
analysis sections re-derives each dependency's *current* hash (recompiling
the dependency if its own cache is stale -- which persists its fresh
interface as a side effect) and compares. A **body-only edit** changes the
dep's MODKEY and rewrites its JIR, but its interface hash comes out the
same, so importers replay instead of cascading. An **interface edit**
changes the hash and exactly the affected importers re-analyze.

Comptime dependencies (`SEC_CTDEPS`) fold in through validity rather than
through the hash: a changed comptime input invalidates the module's cache
entirely, the interface is rebuilt, and the rebuild cascades only if the
exported surface actually moved -- the same cutoff rule. The inputs are
whatever the comptime evaluation actually read: every `embed_file` target,
plus the home module of every comptime binding it unfolded, every ability
body it interpreted, every enum whose member values it read, every
class-body constant it reached through an attribute, and every archetype
whose `has` defaults it folded during construction. Each is attributed to
the module whose expression started the evaluation, so a value that
travelled through an intermediate producer lands on the consumer that baked
it in. The interface hash cannot serve this role: a producer whose comptime
value changed still exports the same interface, which is why folds need
their own section rather than a `SEC_DEPS` row.

Entries are keyed on a content digest, so a rebuild or a `touch` is not an
invalidation. A row records whether the evaluator read the module's source
or interpreted a body out of it, and only the body rows fold in the impl and
test annex digests. That split is what keeps the dev loop cheap: editing an
impl annex of a CLI command module does not rebuild `cli/manifest.jac`,
while editing the declaration that holds the folded `SPEC_*` value does.

A module that folds across a `comptime import` also ingests those producers
with full trees rather than from `SEC_IFACE`: an interface carries the
declared surface, not the initializer the fold has to evaluate. The
ingestion runs at the top of the compile pipeline, so a producer already
resident in the program's hub is taken as it stands; a hub entry that
arrived as a hydrated interface earlier in the same process is therefore not
upgraded, which is why the ingestion is seeded before analysis rather than
on demand.

Every carrier of a fold checks the same section, because any one of them
that does not becomes the stale path:

| Carrier | Rule |
|---|---|
| Module cache | `is_module_cache_valid` fails when a row's digest moved |
| Unsealed precompiled bundle | served only while its rows are fresh; a sealed image is a frozen build and is served on its seal alone |
| Bundle promoted into the module cache | the bundle's rows ride along on the promotion write, absolutized onto the package root |
| Native dependency IR cache | `.ir_cache` is keyed on the module's own source, so its `.ir_meta` stamps the rows the fold read and a hit whose stamp moved is dropped and rebuilt |

Bundle rows are stored relative to the package root so a relocated bundle
still resolves them, and absolutized again on the way into a module cache.

Dependency edges are recorded at the one seam every ingestion path goes
through (`JacProgram.load_dependency_module`), attributed to the innermost
compile frame, so nested dependency compiles record their own edges.

### `SEC_DIAG` -- diagnostics replay

The diagnostics a compile delivered, serialized as flat records (message,
code, full span including the source window, related spans, help text) and
grouped by **analysis profile**: a fingerprint of the compile flavor
(`no_cgen`, `native_parity`) plus the effective diagnostic policy
(suppressions, lint configuration). Replay requires a profile match, which
is what makes it safe that the policy is not part of the ENVKEY.

A warm no-edit `jac check` therefore runs **zero passes**: the module's
MODKEY/ENVKEY are valid, its dependency hashes match, and the stored
profile matches the requested one, so the stored alerts are rehydrated
(rendering byte-identically -- spans carry their source windows) and the
module itself is served from `SEC_IFACE`.

## Hydration is the only path

There is no flag that disables hydration. The two escape hatches are:

- `JAC_REBUILD=1` -- recompute everything and **rewrite** the cache. Results
  are identical by construction; the cache is never silently bypassed.
- `JAC_IFACE_VERIFY=1` -- serve from the cache *and* recompute in a fresh
  program, then diff: hydrated dependency interfaces against a source
  compile of the dep, replayed diagnostics against a fresh analysis. Any
  divergence raises. CI runs the equivalence suites under this mode so
  warmth can never change an observable result silently.

`compile()` keeps its historical return contract: a full-AST module, safe
for every tree-walking caller, present and future. Interface-grade service
is opt-in at the analysis-frontier seams via
`CompileOptions(iface_ok=True)`: dependency ingestion
(`load_dependency_module`), the registry's own dependency revalidation, and
check-style full-analysis compiles. A missed opt-in costs only caching,
never correctness. The one propagating override is
`CompileOptions(need_full_ast=True)` -- a consumer whose *transitive
dependency ingestion* must also be trees (code intelligence, which records
cross-module use-sites) declares it once and it flows through. Neither is a
cache toggle: the frontier seams opt in unconditionally, so hydration is
always on where analysis happens.

## Where it hooks

| Seam | Role |
|------|------|
| `JacCompiler._compile_once` | Serves eligible compiles from the cache before parsing; persists the analysis sections after the pipeline runs |
| `JacProgram.load_dependency_module` | Hub first (dirty buffers shadow disk), then the registry, then a source compile on a miss; records dependency edges |
| `JacProgram.iface_registry` (`compiler/driver/ifacecache.jac`) | Per-program registry: entry freshness, dep-hash validation, hydration, replay, verify |
| `write_module_cache` | Atomic merge-write: analysis writers and the bytecode writer share one JIR per module |
| LSP `_fanout_dependents` | Seeds the reverse-import index from persisted `SEC_DEPS` on first use, so who-imports-X fan-out works from a cold start |

Third-party surface: typed `.py` modules under site-packages persist and
hydrate interfaces under a toolchain+content key (`is_stub_like_path`), so
each is frontend-processed at most once per content across all processes.
`.pyi` files outside the bundled typeshed catalog deliberately keep their
real-AST derivation (a pinned identity contract; their frontend is the
cheap phase) -- they participate in `SEC_DEPS` through their content key
instead, so a stub edit still re-analyzes its importers.

The compiler's own tree is an ordinary citizen of the cache. The selfhost
program (the compiler compiling itself) hydrates and persists like any
other program; the one bootstrap rule is readiness, not identity. While the
interface codec's own modules (the type evaluator and the stubcat reader,
writer and modiface) are not yet importable, or are mid-import, `eligible`
answers no and those compiles run cold. The jac0 seed tier never goes
through `compile()` and does not know the cache exists.

Interfaces are encoded only inside analysis-driven closures: the compile
at the root of the closure (the outermost `compile()` call) must be a
`no_cgen` or `symtab_ir_only` compile. A codegen-driven closure, which is
what an import or `jac run` produces, records `SEC_DEPS` and
`SEC_PLACEMENT` for every module it touches and leaves `SEC_IFACE` to the
first analysis-driven closure that asks for it. Encoding forces the type of
every export, which cascades dependency ingestion through the reachable
closure, so an import-order rebuild of the compiler must never trigger it;
the first `jac check`, LSP open or precompile analysis produces each
interface once and every later consumer hydrates.

Dependency rows exempt only modules inside the compiler digest roots
(`is_compiler_tree_path`): every ENVKEY folds the compiler digest, so any
edit there invalidates every JIR wholesale and a row would be redundant.
Non-root jaclang modules (cli, server, scale, byllm and friends) are mutable
within a generation and carry rows like any other dependency. The registry
reads the module cache first and the sealed image second, but a sealed
image carries no analysis sections yet: the seal must be a pure function of
content, and sections copied from a module cache depend on that cache's
history. Producing them deterministically at seal time, by running the
analysis frontier per unit, is the precompiler's follow-up.

A Jac instance method's interface symbol carries an instance-method bit
(`SYMF_INSTANCE_METHOD`), which the unbound-call check reads in place of the
real `Ability` node, so `Cls.method(self, ...)` through a hydrated class
binds like it does through a real tree while the member's type stays the
self-less form the tree presents. The writer also materializes the members
the evaluator would only discover lazily (an `init` parameter or a `self.x`
assignment first looked up on a miss), so an interface never depends on
which attributes an earlier closure happened to touch.

## The codegen lane

Codegen is the must-recompute core, so the cache helps it at the edges
rather than the center:

- **Precompile re-wraps the module cache.** A valid module-cache JIR already
  holds a unit's bytecode; `precompile_unit` re-keys and re-roots it
  directly instead of taking a `get_bytecode` round trip (which would still
  pay hub churn, native-engine restoration, and closure release). A cold
  `jac precompile` over a tree any prior run has compiled collapses to IO.
- **Interface bytes are memoized by MODKEY**, so re-persisting an unchanged
  module (a check after a run, a precompile after a check, a dependency the
  client-boundary walk re-enters) reuses the encoded payload instead of
  re-deriving it. Encoding forces every exported symbol's type, which pulls
  the module's own dependencies in, so the memo is bounded by count at
  closure release, never cleared: clearing it made a cold littleX precompile
  re-ingest 64 dependency modules.
- **The client-boundary walk consumes persisted facts.** When a changed
  module's client dependency is cache-valid, the walk restores the dep's
  interop manifest from `SEC_INTEROP` into `hub.artifacts` (the carrier
  interop consumers check first) and continues traversal over the dep's
  client-context edges recorded in `SEC_DEPS` flags, tree-compiling only on
  a miss. Implicit dataclass constructors synthesize from the interface's
  field-symbol surface (order, types, default and defer bits on each field
  symbol) when a class in the mro is interface-borne, because the cold
  synthesis walks `HasVar` nodes an interface module does not carry -- and
  a subclass must keep regenerating its constructor rather than inheriting
  a frozen one.

## Instrumentation

Every pass execution and cache event is counted on the program
(`JacProgram.analysis.pass_runs`, `.pass_time`, `.cache_events`), and the
acceptance tests (`tests/compiler/test_iface_cache.jac`) assert against
those counters, not timing: a warm no-edit check must show
`analysis_replay == 1` and an empty `pass_runs`; a body-only dep edit must
show the dep's `dep_miss_compile` without the importer's `TypeCheckPass`.
The timing decomposition (`tests/compiler/test_compile_timing.jac` and its
probe) carries `analysis` and `check` phases so cold/warm costs stay
attributable against the pinned baseline.

## Measurements

Stage 0 baseline and Stage 8 re-measurement on the chess fixture (warm
no-edit check, single-module-edit check, cold LSP start) are recorded on the
tracking issue and summarized here once the final numbers land with the
change itself.

## Non-goals (unchanged from the gate)

- Per-expression type hydration: hover data is served by the LSP's live
  in-memory program.
- Caching comptime execution, the placement solve, or import-graph
  resolution: comptime executes code, the solve is whole-program (over
  cached summaries), and the import graph is filesystem truth.
